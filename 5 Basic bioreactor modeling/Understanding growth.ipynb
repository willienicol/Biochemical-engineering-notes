    "Think of bacteria as an investment in the bank. Take an investment of a $1000$ dollar, with an interest rate of 12% per year. The question is how much interest will be earned after a year. Is it a mere $120$ dollar where 12% gets added after a year, or should the interest rather be calculated on a monthly basis where 1% interest will be earned in a month? This should be better since the growth of the investment is calculated more regularly and accordingly the earned interest can start to earn interest of its own. You should be able to show to yourself that if interest is calculated on a monthly basis (1% per month) the investment will be worth $1000\\times(1.01)^{12}=1126.83$ after a year, so an $126.83$ dollar increase instead of $120$ dollar. The greedy will now demand a daily calculation of interests so that the annual growth will be $1000\\times(1+\\frac{0.12}{365})^{365}-1000 = 127.48$. The super greedy will demand an instantaneous calculation of interest, so that the maximum can be earned. Doing this will result in the absolute maximum of $127.50$ dollar annual growth. The calculation is based on a continuous function, where the time differential of **the investment (x)**  is given by:\n",

    "If you understand instantaneous interest you understand $\\mu$. From an investment perspective of growth we might be interested in calculating the **fractional hourly increase (FHI)** of biomass. Show to yourself that:\n",
