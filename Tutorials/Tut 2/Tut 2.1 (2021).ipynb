    "Now it's your turn to apply some coding principles. This question entails the optimization of a cylindrical shape in order to minimize heat loss. Imagine you have a solid cylinder with a volume of $10 m^{3}$ with a uniform temperature (Ts) of 400 K. The room temperature (Tr) is at 280 K. The convective heat transfer coefficient (h) is 15 $W/m^{2}K$. \n",
