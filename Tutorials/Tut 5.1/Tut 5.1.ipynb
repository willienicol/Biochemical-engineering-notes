    "## Tutorial 5.1 - Measuring $\\mu$\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to understand the concept of specific growth rate ($\\mu$). Remember the following definition that you have used before:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r_x = \\mu \\Rightarrow \\frac{g \\,X}{g \\,X \\cdot h} \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{h}$$\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the $\\mu$ concept we will use aerobic growth of _Escherichia coli_. Higher biomass concentrations ($C_X$) is typically associated by an increase in turbidity as can be seen in the **time progression of a single test tube** below. The suspended biomass concentration can be quantified via spectrophotometry.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC_X}{dt}=\\mu C_X $$  \n",

    "\n",
    "b) It is easy to solve the above equation analytically, but for now we will solve it numerically using the background form [chapter 5.2](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/willienicol/Biochemical-engineering-notes/blob/master/5%20Basic%20bioreactor%20modeling/Solving%20differential%20equations.ipynb).\n",
    "Choose arbitrary values for $\\mu$ and plot the solution together with the experimental data in (a) on a single graph. Remember that $C_X =0.1 \\frac{g}{L}$ at time zero. Note that by definition $\\mu$ has unit of $\\frac{1}{h}$. Explain your graph to your friends.\n",
