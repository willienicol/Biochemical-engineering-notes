All equations are equal to zero except the energy balance that is equal to $\\theta$. All rates correspond to the flux numbers on the map with $r_{11}$ representing $CO_2$\n",

Operate the fermenter aerobically for 15 hours by sparging with oxygen and then switch to sparging with $CO_2$. Note that the specifications in the response matrix will alter between aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Integrate the aerobic and anaerobic sections separately, but plot together on a single graph. Determine the APY and productivity of the total fermentation. Compare to the answer in (e) and explain to yourself. What happened to $C_{SA}^{final}$ when comparing to (e)? Also play with increasing the aerobic fermentation time. Take enough time in understanding the concentration profiles and don't just focus on getting the answers. \n",
