    "## 1. Sugar metabolism\n",
    "\n",
    "The human metabolism is a complex system to study as it takes place in various organs in the body and there are many different interactions at play. In essence, food consists of three main components: proteins, carbohydrates (sugars), and lipids (fats). These components are each converted to energy through different metabolic pathways. In this course, we are mostly interested in the metabolism of sugar. To simplify it even more, we only look at one type of sugar: glucose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Glucose is broken down by our body through glycolysis and then used in the TCA cycle to provide energy to our cells. The process of breaking down glucose in the cells is done in the presence of oxygen. If no oxygen is available, the glucose is fermented and it will form lactic acid (in humans).\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at dietary intake, 1 gram of sugar provides us with about 4 kcal. The amount of calories consumed by a human-being is dependent on their work output. The work output becomes higher as a person becomes more active. For the average female 1800-2200 kcal need to be consumed a day to maintain their weight, whereas for the average male this lies between 2500-2800 kcal. The work output is usually expressed in [W/kg].\n",
    "\n",
    "The following formula shows the overall reaction of glucose consumption in our cells:\n",
    "$C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + x O_{2} \\rightarrow y CO_{2} + z H_{2}O + energy$\n",

    "b) Assume that all the sugar in the can of coke is glucose. How many moles of glucose is the person drinking?\n",

    "## 2. Oxygen consumption rates\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the overall reaction, oxygen is consumed during the sugar metabolism. Usually, sufficient oxygen is present and no fermentation takes place. However, when we play sports, our glucose consumption rate sky-rockets and thus, our oxygen consumption rate needs to keep up. This is possible to a certain extent, however, at a point we hit a ceiling. This ceiling is called our maximal oxygen uptake or $V_{O2max}$. This value is different for each individual and can be increased by doing exercise or, for smokers, quitting smoking. On average, the $V_{O2max}$ of a healthy male is 35–40 mL/(kg·min) and for a female 27–31 mL/(kg·min). This is pretty low compared to other animals such as Alaskan huskies. In the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race their $V_{O2max}$ values were recorded as high as 240 mL/(kg·min). If the $V_{O2max}$ is exceeded, no more oxygen can be taken up by the body and anaerobic processes start to occur. This is when lactic acid forms in the muscles and terrible muscle aches develop. \n",

How big must their breaths be to provide sufficient oxygen to burn all the glucose (in mL)? Assume the ideal gas law holds. The conditions are P = 101.325 kPa and T = 298 K.\n",

    "c) A person breathes 12 times a minute and their breath is 200 mL of air.(Assume the ideal gas law holds. The conditions are P = 101.325 kPa and T = 298 K.) They use oxygen with 70% efficiency. How much glucose can they burn in an hour (moles)? How many calories does this glucose equal to (assume: 1 gram glucose = 4 kcal)? Would you say this person was most likely at rest or doing physical exercise? (See: https://www.bmi3d.com/calorieconsumption.html)"
