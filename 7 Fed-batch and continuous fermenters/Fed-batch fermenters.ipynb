    "## Fed-batch fermentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this example/tutorial is to show the advantage of using fed-batch fermenters. The notes will guide you into calculations that you will have to perform yourself in order to understand the core principles of this fermentation mode. Numerous microbes have slow growth rates when exposed to high substrate concentrations. Accordingly all the substrate cannot be added at the start of the fermentation (like all the batch fermenter examples that we have done up to now). To keep the substrate concentration in the fermenter low, substrate can be added continuously to compensate for the consumption of substrate by the microbes. We will show how this strategy is highly beneficial to productivity and hence the economics of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical description of the fermentation process will alter slightly since the liquid volume in the fermenter will increase as time progress. It will be shown how the cmol balance can be adapted to incorporate the continuous feed of substrate (glucose). \n",

    "As example we'll use a _Lactobacillus_ strain that is severely inhibited by high glucose concentrations. Lactic acid will be the sole excreted metabolite in the example. Let's jump in by setting up the flux model for the organism. The necessary theory will follow as we progress through the problem. The metabolic map is given below:\n",

    "The glucose concentration against time had an interesting characteristic. There is an initial bump followed by an **almost zero** 'regime' of $C_S$. This relates to the amount of biomass in the fermenter ($C_X$) and the constant addition rate of glucose. Initially $C_X$ is not enough to consume all the added glucose and accordingly there is accumulation of glucose. As $C_X$ is increased the condition is reversed up to the point where **all glucose fed is immediately consumed**. This occurs at around 43 hours. For the remainder of the fermentation the glucose addition rate controls the growth and production of lactic acid. Play around with changing $Q^F$ and see whether the profiles make sense. Remember that high $C_S$ will inhibit $\\mu$ and that the magnitude of $\\mu$ determines the uptake of glucose.\n"
