    "### 1.1.\tWhat is this course about?\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is about micro-organisms (or microbes) and how they can be used as workhorses to produce useful chemicals. The microbes will be placed in bioreactors (or fermenters) where the conversion of cheap sugars to expensive chemicals will take place. The video below will give you some perspective of where we are going:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Lecture 1 Video: What is this course about?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur6SfJ-u1CU)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to describe or model the fermenter we need to understand how the microbes work. First we’ll start with some basic biology principles. Thereafter we’ll get into biochemistry where we’ll study the reaction steps required to convert sugar to the various chemicals. Once this is under the knee we’ll employ linear algebra to describe the overall bioreaction that the microbe causes. The word ‘overall’ implies that only the molecules that enter (uptake) and exit (excretion) the microbe will be considered. We will also use our knowledge of the internal bioreaction steps (metabolism) to extend the  description of the overall bioreaction. In essence we’ll reduce the life of the microbe to a single reaction, where the rates of this reaction will be referred to as the response function. It will become clear that the stoichiometry of the response function will vary as conditions in the fermenter change, this is unlike a normal chemical reactions where stoichiometry is fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"microbe1.jpg\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Once comfortable with describing the response function, we’ll link the response function to the mathematical description of the fermenter. It will be shown how differential equations that incorporate the response function can be used to realistically model what is happening in the fermenter. From a Bioprocess Engineering viewpoint a proper description of the fermenter is the ultimate goal since this is required to design, operate and optimize the unit that will be producing the commodity chemical.\n",
    "From a mathematical perspective this is a beautiful course. Have you ever heard the ancient saying?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Change your environment to change yourself._\n",
    "\n",
    "The saying was meant for humans, but it applies perfectly to the microbes that we will be describing. The natural response of the microbes to the fermenter environment will change the fermenter environment and this in turn will change the response of the microbes. It is a story of an interactive cycle and it be told in math, where the varying concentrations in the fermenter will directly link to changing the outcome from the response function. Effectively we’ll embed matrices (giving the response function) in differential equations (fermenter function) towards the end of the course. This might sound daunting at this stage, but with the magic of Python you will see that it is not that hard.\n",
    "So there you have it, a whole mouthful of what we will be doing. Don’t worry if some of the sentences above reads like Greek. Revisit this introductory section at a later stage to access whether you still have an overview of the course. This simplified video might be helpful:\n",

    "### 1.1.\t2.\tWhy is this course important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Biotechnology is about using various life forms to make commercial products. Bioprocessing is the chemical engineering discipline of making this happen. Micro-organisms (microbes) are the most common life form in bioprocessing applications where bacteria, yeasts and fungi are exploited as workhorses  to facilitate the conversion of a cheap feed into a value added products. This course will focus on the synthesis of value added products but it should be stated that bioprocessing is not restricted to this type of product. Microbes are often use for clean-up where the end product is  bio-remediated, just think of a sewage plant for treating wastewater. Bioprocessing is an ancient discipline and has been used for centuries in the production of foods and beverages such as yoghurt, bread, vinegar, soy sauce, beer and wine. Today numerous commercial bioprocesses are used to produce bulk chemicals (like citric acid), proteins (like enzymes), amino acids, vitamins, antibiotics and even fuels. You are regularly using products where a microbe was part of the production train. Just think of the antibiotic and vitamins that helped to cure that terrible cold, the enzymes in your washing power giving that shining white, the citric acid keeping your soft drink preserved, the ethanol addition to your car fuel and of course the ethanol in you party drinks. These little organisms have been working for you for a long time! \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"biorefine1.jpg\" width=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dependency on micro-organisms is likely to grow in the future. The world is slowly moving away from  fossil reserves like coal, oil and natural gas. The reason is twofold: the supplies are limited and the environmental consequences of using fossil reserves are severe. One might think of the refinery as the supplier of various fuels like petrol, diesel and jet fuel but it is important to realise that a major fraction of bulk chemicals have their origin in the refinery. Just look around you and you will find materials that originated from the refinery everywhere. The plastic in your smartphone, the synthetic materials in your clothes, all the containers of your food and drinks and the non-metal parts of your car. The list goes on to show you how intimately you are connected to fossil reserves. How will the dependency be broken? We are definitely not ready to part with all the wonderful end-products. The solution is to use sustainable feedstock (like plant matter) to generate the same materials. This will be performed in the biorefinery, where microbes will play an important role. In essence microbes will feed on various sugars in plants and excrete useful molecules that can be used as chemicals or fuel. More than two thirds of dry plant matter consists out of sugars, whether the plant contains edible parts or not. So a non-fossil alternative exist but clever chemical engineers will be required to make the bioconversion processes economical. This is exactly the reason why this course is part of you undergraduate curriculum. See this explanation from TU Delft in the Netherlands:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Video: TU Delft on biobased economy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MXHfZqbrCs)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of any bioprocess is the bioreactor or fermenter. This is the unit in the process where the chemical transformation is taking place. It might not always be the most expensive unit in the process, but it typically is the most important unit in the sense that all development is centred around the bioreactor. The economy of the conversion will be highly  dependent on speediness (productivity), yield and product titre. High yield will imply that most of the carbon in the raw feed (sugar) will end up in the targeted product. Titre refers to the final product concentration where high titres typically reduce downstream separation costs. These economic indicators can easily be calculated from the fermenter models given in the course.\n"

    "Before we can model the biochemical behaviour of a microbe we need to understand the basics of microbes. We therefore need to understand the basics of how life works. The course aims at performing engineering calculations and not at memorising microbiology and biochemistry textbooks. But the calculations will be based on prerequisite knowledge of these disciplines. You need to understand these basics but you don’t need to remember all the terms. We’ll use the internet as an extension of our memory given the availability of the internet nowadays. You need to be acquainted with the basics so that you can easily Google new questions. The background in this and the following section (basic biochemistry) is by no means complete, it is only the first few guided steps that will enable further and self-development of your understanding of microbes. Get used to formulate and answer questions with the internet, but be careful for a single answer, rather search for different people saying the same thing in different words. Internet literature on basic microbiology and biochemistry is mature with wonderful pictures and videos available. Use it and enjoy, the magic is in the palm of your hand.    \n",

    "Every living thing requires a scientific name. The organisation structure for giving names changed throughout the last centuries, but let’s starts with a primary school lesson on the topic since we are beginners.\n",

Fungi and yeasts are eukaryotes (see if you can find them). Some bioprocesses employ archaea under harsh conditions, while normal bacteria is a common workhorse, especially _Escherichia Coli_.  Although all microbes share a common ancestor it is important to understand the difference between these organisms. Check this clip for basic differences between the domain branches:\n",

    "When looking at the carbohydrates you should see that only carbon, oxygen and hydrogen form the sugar molecules. In fact the generic molecular formula is $(CH_2O)_n$, so there is effectively a water molecule for each carbon and thus the name carbohydrates. Don’t confuse this with the term hydrocarbons where oxygen is missing from the generic molecular formula. Have a look at this clip for more background on sugar.\n",

    "The 3D orientation of the monosaccharide bond plays an important role in the properties of the polysaccharide. It is much harder to break the beta bonds of cellulose and thus it acts as an important structural component in plants. In the biorefinery it will be very important to release the monosaccharides from cellulose in order to utilise the inedible parts of the plant. In this regard 5 carbon sugars ($C_5$) are also a major source of inedible plant carbohydrates. See this picture of plant cell walls and identify the xylose monomers in hemicellulose:\n",

You should also understand how double bonds in fatty acids produce ‘kinks’ in the linear structure. Remember the structure of glycerol, you will see it again when we discuss metabolic pathways. Exercise yourself by drawing the molecular structures with a pen and paper (and check via using Google images). Have a look at how biodiesel is produced via trans esterification of triglycerides.\n"

    "You don’t need to know the name of all the transcription factors (types of proteins) but understand how the promoter site (in this case the TATA box) is used to mark where the gene starts. It is also important to understand that transcription can be regulated by transcription factors. We are not going into detail here but you should understand that the type of proteins that a cell requires varies depending on external factors and hence gene expression should be regulated and controlled according to the cell’s requirements. Complex interactions of numerous transcription factors make this possible.\n",

    "As chemical engineers we are interested in speed of transcription and translation. _E.coli_ can achieve transcription rates of 60 nucleotides per second with the corresponding translation rate of 20 amino acids per second.
